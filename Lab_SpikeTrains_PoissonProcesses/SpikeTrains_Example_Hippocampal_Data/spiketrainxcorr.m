function [timebase,rawcorr,corr_sm] = spiketrainxcorr(spikes1,spikes2,bin,tmax,sw1)
%               
% Inputs:       spikes1 is a n x 1 vector containing n time stamps of spikes 
%               of cell 1
%
%               spikes2 is a m x 1 vector containing m time stamps of spikes 
%               of cell 2
%
%               bin is the bin size to compute the cross-correlation (s)
%  
%               tmax is the range of the time lags, so the window is [-tmax, tmax]
%
%               sw1 is the size of the smoothing window (s)
%               
%               
% Outputs:      timebase is the time (lag) axis, = -tmax:bin:tmax
%               
%               rawcorr is the raw cross-correlation
%               
%               corr_sm is the smoothed cross-correlation
%               
% Description:  Performs cross-correlation on two input spike trains
